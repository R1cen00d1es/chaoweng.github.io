I am currently a postdoc working with Prof Sean Hallgren in the [CS theory group](https://theory.cse.psu.edu/) at the Pennsylvania State University. Next spring, I will join University of Cincinnati as a tenure-track assistant professor in Deparment of Computer Science. I have a Ph.D. in computer science and engineering from the State University of New York at Buffalo.

I am interested in theoretical computer science in general. Recently, my research mainly focuses on studying specific problems in which quantum computers demonstrates provable advantages compared to classical ones.

Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
